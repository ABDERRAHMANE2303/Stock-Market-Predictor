Flask==3.0.3 # Let's use a very stable Flask version first, you can try 3.1.0 later
Flask-CORS==4.0.1 # Stable version
# prophet==1.1.6 # If 1.1.5 works, stick with it, otherwise try 1.1.6
# prophet==1.1.5 # Often more readily available wheel for Windows
# pandas==2.2.3
# numpy>=1.26.0,<2.1.0 # e.g., numpy==1.26.4 will be picked by pip
# scikit-learn==1.5.0 # Let's use a stable scikit-learn, you can try 1.6.1 later
# yfinance==0.2.38 # Stable yfinance

# # TensorFlow: Try 2.15.0 first. It has good compatibility with Python 3.9-3.11 (64-bit)
# tensorflow==2.15.0
# If tensorflow==2.15.0 still fails, and you've confirmed Python 3.9-3.11 64-bit,
# you can try letting pip choose the latest compatible version by just using:
# tensorflow

# gunicorn==23.0.0 # Gunicorn is for Linux/macOS deployments. Not typically used/needed for Windows development.
# For Windows production, consider 'waitress'. For development, Flask's built-in server is fine.
